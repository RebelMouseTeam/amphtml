          Why RebelMouse? The Best Centralized, Social CMS
        </h2>
        <p>
          RebelMouse is the best CMS for social growth, with a platform built
          for content creators to thrive in the age of social. See how we got
          here + how you can join us and start growing within days!
        </p>
        <p>
          Chances are that the CMS you work in every day was built before social
          — before the idea of distributed content was even coined. Even though
          publishing has changed dramatically, a lot of that heavy and outdated
          tech still exists today.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, WordPress has more than 87 million sites, but each
          platform update still has to be pushed out individually to each and
          every one of those customers. By contrast, RebelMouse is a centralized
          CMS, meaning our updates are pushed out to all of our sites at once
          (and sometimes even multiple times a day). We are always updating and
          integrating which is why we are quickly becoming the most sought-after
          alternative to WordPress VIP, with a platform that features content
          creation tools integrated directly into social APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Websites became a part of our lives long before the revelation that
          fans are born in the feeds. The opportunity to reach huge social
          audiences is now, but that doesn't mean the website is dead.
          Publishing has just evolved.

        <h3 class="headline-amp">2004: The Blogger.com Movement</h3>
        <p>
          In 2004, the world was introduced to the digital diary, aka blogging.
          Blogger.com launched and fueled this movement, gaining incredible
          traction in the marketing community. "Blog" was even declared word of
          the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When

          >, the importance of blogging and its position in mainstream media was
          solidified. It became a new outlet used to reach audiences in the
          ever-changing world of digital, and, soon after, a base for

        <h3>2005: HuffPost Launches</h3>
        <p>
          In 2005, HuffPost launched, redefining the nature of online commentary
          as we knew it. Backed by some big names, HuffPost quickly began
          changing the way we publish and consume content online. RebelMouse CEO
          and founder Paul Berry was CTO of HuffPost when it launched, greatly
          impacting the new media world we currently live in today.

        <h3>2008: WordPress Grows, a Ton</h3>
        <p>
          2008 was about the time when WordPress began to gain massive scale.
          Page views and global unique visitors grew like crazy, and millions of
          new blogs were being created each year. The company continued their
          quest for dominance with plans to continue releasing new,
          user-friendly updates.During this period, 90% of traffic to websites
          still came from Google.
        </p>
        <h3>2009: The Rise of Facebook</h3>
        <p>
          2009 proved to be the year that social media went mainstream — the
          year everyone in the family jumped on board, and not just to post a
          status update about what they ate. Twitter + Facebook now featured
          breaking news and political events ... all in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses started to embrace the social platforms as a way to
          communicate directly with customers. And while new users spiked for a
          slew of new platforms during this time (Twitter, Reddit, YouTube),
          Facebook was quietly staking its claim as the dominate figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facebook grew by over 200 million users in 2009. With various updates
          that focused on content creation, a real-time feed, and the Open
          Stream API, Facebook saw astronomical growth.
